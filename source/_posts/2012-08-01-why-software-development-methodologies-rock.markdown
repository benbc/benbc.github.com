(This post was insprired by a sneak preview of [a blog
post](http://continuousdelivery.com/2012/07/why-software-development-methodologies-suck/
"Why software development methodologies suck") by Jez Humble.)

Methodologies or other defined practices can have value in so far as
they cause people to reflect on and criticise what they are
doing. Often it's the *adoption* of a new approach that brings
benefits, rather than the approach itself.

This is why consultants are all convinced that their approach is the
one-true-way. They tend to meet teams that have stopped reflecting and
so are in trouble. They introduce change and see that everything
magically starts to improve. A spot of attributional bias and they're
convinced.

The subjects of their advice, however, see that things get worse again
after a while (because they've stopped reflecting). So they conclude
that methodology X is all very well, but in practice it doesn't work
in the long term.

It takes a special kind of person and team to keep reflecting even
when there is no change agent. People who can do this without any
prompting are gold dust and don't need a methodology. People who can
*nearly* do it benefit from *any* methodology that they can be
convinced by, because the existence of an ideal keeps them thinking
about how they are deviating from it (and it's the thinking that
matters, not the extent of the deviation).

My experience has informed my opinion. My first job was for a small
software shop that followed a rigorous waterfall approach: strong
hierarchy, lots of documentation, estimation-by-loc-guessing, separate
development phases. They were extremely successful and repeatedly
delivered on-time and within-budget; I was miserable. My second job
was as a consultant (with [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com)).
